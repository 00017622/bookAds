The ShareBook website is the project where users should register or login to create their first book ad in case they have to share it or sell it, they view all the books ads from other people too, but they can in addition, view only their book ads, delete, edit or create new which will be connected to their specific account. Apart from logging in and registering, the users can also view their profile data and update it. Plus, the other thing I did was filtering the book ads by category.

The link to public domain of the website on render.com cloud, for some reason could not upload to glitch:
